## This script will create a commit for each day, starting from 365 days ago and going back to the present day. After creating all commits, it will push them to the remote repository. Make sure to run this script in a Git repository directory, and ensure that Git is properly configured to perform commits and push to a remote repository. You can change the number of days in the code.
